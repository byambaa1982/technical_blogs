## Understanding the PySpark `coalesce` Function: A Simple Guide

#### Problem Introduction

When working with big data using PySpark, you'll often find datasets with missing values (nulls) across several columns. Letâ€™s say you have a table with user choices, but users could leave some choices empty. You want to find the userâ€™s top preference by looking at their first, then second, then third choice in that orderâ€”choosing the first value that isnâ€™t null.

How do you do this easily without a tangle of `when` and `otherwise` statements or custom Python code? Thatâ€™s where the `coalesce` function comes in!

## What is `coalesce` in PySpark?

PySparkâ€™s `coalesce` function lets you easily pick the first non-null value from a list of columns per row. It works just like the SQL COALESCE, but in your Spark DataFrame pipeline.

## Example Data

Letâ€™s start with a sample DataFrame. Hereâ€™s what the data might look like in markdown:

```markdown
| username       | first_choice | second_choice | third_choice |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| Data Logic Hub | X           | facebook      | Instragram   |
| User 2         | NULL        | NULL          | NULL         |
| User 3         | facebook    | NULL          | Instragram   |
| User 4         | NULL        | X             | NULL         |
| User 5         | NULL        | NULL          | facebook     |
```

---

## How Not To Do It: Using Multiple `when` Statements

Before using `coalesce`, you might think about writing a bunch of `when` checks like this:

```python
from pyspark.sql import functions as F

df = df.withColumn(
    "Choice",
    F.when(F.col("first_choice").isNotNull(), F.col("first_choice"))
     .when(F.col("second_choice").isNotNull(), F.col("second_choice"))
     .when(F.col("third_choice").isNotNull(), F.col("third_choice"))
)
```

This works, but can get messy if you have more columns. If you add a fourth or fifth choice, your code gets even longer and harder to read.

## Solution: Using `coalesce` (the Easy Way)

`coalesce` keeps your code neat, and itâ€™s built for exactly this job. Hereâ€™s how it works:

```python
from pyspark.sql import functions as F

resultDF = df.withColumn(
    "Choice",
    F.coalesce(F.col("first_choice"), F.col("second_choice"), F.col("third_choice"))
)
resultDF.show()
```

### Output Table

```markdown
| username       | first_choice | second_choice | third_choice | Choice   |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| Data Logic Hub | X           | facebook      | Instragram   | X        |
| User 2         | NULL        | NULL          | NULL         | NULL     |
| User 3         | facebook    | NULL          | Instragram   | facebook |
| User 4         | NULL        | X             | NULL         | X        |
| User 5         | NULL        | NULL          | facebook     | facebook |
```

---

## Why Use `coalesce`?

- **Clean and Simple:** One line replaces many.
- **Easy to Extend:** Just add more columns to the function, no need to keep adding more `when` clauses.
- **Works Fast:** Native Spark performance.
- **Handles Any Datatype:** Works for strings, numbers, etc.

## More Examples

### Example 1: Filling Default Values

Suppose your columns have `NULL`s and you want to make sure thereâ€™s always a fallback value.

```python
resultDF = df.withColumn(
    "FilledChoice",
    F.coalesce(F.col("first_choice"), F.col("second_choice"), F.lit("No Choice Given"))
)
resultDF.show()
```

**Output:**

```markdown
| username       | first_choice | second_choice | third_choice | FilledChoice     |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|------------------|
| Data Logic Hub | X           | facebook      | Instragram   | X                |
| User 2         | NULL        | NULL          | NULL         | No Choice Given  |
| User 3         | facebook    | NULL          | Instragram   | facebook         |
| User 4         | NULL        | X             | NULL         | X                |
| User 5         | NULL        | NULL          | facebook     | No Choice Given  |
```

### Example 2: Numeric Data

If you have columns like `score1`, `score2`, and `score3` and you want the first available score:

```python
df2 = spark.createDataFrame([
    ("A", None, 5, 10),
    ("B", 3, None, None),
    ("C", None, None, None)
], ["user", "score1", "score2", "score3"])

resultDF2 = df2.withColumn(
    "FirstScore",
    F.coalesce(F.col("score1"), F.col("score2"), F.col("score3"))
)
resultDF2.show()
```

**Output:**

```markdown
| user | score1 | score2 | score3 | FirstScore |
|------|--------|--------|--------|------------|
| A    | NULL   | 5      | 10     | 5          |
| B    | 3      | NULL   | NULL   | 3          |
| C    | NULL   | NULL   | NULL   | NULL       |
```

## Final Thoughts

Whenever you want to take the first non-null value from several columns and keep your logic simple, PySparkâ€™s `coalesce` is your friend. It makes your ETL steps easier to read and maintain, helps you deal with missing data naturally, and is a common tool every PySpark user should understand.

**Remember:**
- Use `F.coalesce()` with as many columns as needed.
- Use `F.col("colname")` when referring to your columns inside the function.
